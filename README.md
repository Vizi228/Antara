## Description

For this project I used RabbitMq as message broker, Nest JS as main NodeJs framework and Redis for data persistence. 
Also I used swagger for api documentation and handlebars for templates 

## What can I improve
Of course if it was production project, I would use separated front-end application and also .env files wouldn't be in this repo

## Running the app

```bash
$ docker-compose up
# After that open application on localhost:3000
```
